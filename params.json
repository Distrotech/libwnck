{"name":"Libwnck","tagline":"Mirror of https://git.gnome.org/browse/libwnck","body":"libwnck\r\n=======\r\n\r\nlibwnck is Window Navigator Construction Kit, i.e. a library to use\r\nfor writing pagers and taskslists and stuff.  \r\n\r\nlibwnck is not supported in the devel platform, which means OS vendors\r\nwon't guarantee the API/ABI long-term, but authors of open source apps\r\nshould feel free to use libwnck as users can always recompile against\r\na new version. The API/ABI has historically changed very little: we are\r\nnot changing it gratuitously or without soname increments.\r\n\r\nDocumentation for the API is available with gtk-doc. The code\r\nimplementing the tasklist or pager widgets (tasklist.c and pager.c) can\r\nalso be used as sample code.\r\n\r\nYou may download updates to the package from:\r\n\r\n   http://download.gnome.org/sources/libwnck/\r\n\r\nTo discuss libwnck, you may use the desktop-devel-list mailing list:\r\n\r\n  http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/desktop-devel-list\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nSee the file 'INSTALL'.
